## Hi there 👋
CS student at the Łódź University.
Focused on C++ and core computer science fundamentals.

These days I’m focused on:
- C++ (main language)
- Python (for scripting and experimentation)
- Deepening core CS knowledge

## Projects I've Built So Far 🚀:
- [Currency Converter](https://github.com/shiirotech/Currency_converter) – A C++ program that converts between fiat, crypto, and magical currencies.
